Git and shell configurations were based on [Petr Zemek's dotfiles repository](https://github.com/s3rvac/dotfiles) described in [this video](https://youtu.be/woCwZ9OnvYo).
Neovim configurations were based on [Christian Chiarulli's articles](https://www.chrisatmachine.com/neovim) and [Brodie Robertson's configs](https://github.com/BrodieRobertson/dotfiles/tree/master/config/nvim).
Many configurations use or are based on [DT's (Derek Taylor) dotfiles repository and his configurations](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/).
